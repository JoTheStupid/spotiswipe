# spotiswipe
A little python thing that lets you swipe through your playlists and sort them into 2 things
##What is Spotiswipe?
Spotiswipe is a small project I made. I use spotify often, and my main playlist has over 230 songs, so an application that lets me sort them out into moods is extremely helpful. Using the spotify python API, you can do that with this.
